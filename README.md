## 1. TL;DR for Recruiters

* **Business Impact:** Automates the daily processing of raw transaction logs into an analysis-ready, enriched BigQuery table. Enables near real-time fraud risk assessment, replacing slow, manual, and error-prone analysis.
* **Technical Impact:** Demonstrates a modern, serverless GCP data stack. The pipeline is fully automated via Airflow, scalable via Dataproc Serverless, and reliable due to CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and robust unit testing (PyTest).
* **Core Skills:**
    * **Data Processing:** PySpark (DataFrames, SQL, transformations, joins).
    * **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow (GCP Composer, DAGs, Operators, Sensors).
    * **Cloud Platform:** GCP (Dataproc, BigQuery, GCS, Composer).
    * **DevOps/DataOps:** CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Unit Testing with PyTest.
    * **Language:** Python.
